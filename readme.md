# a09-akari

A great final project for COMP 301 at UNC, we were tasked with recreating the puzzle game Akari in Java using JavaFX and CSS, using the Model View Controller Design pattern. Everything was coded from scratch in this assignment (i.e. no starter code or template) and this taught me a lot about OOP and app development.
